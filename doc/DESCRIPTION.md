Prosody is a modern XMPP communication server. It aims to be easy to set up and configure, and efficient with system resources. Additionally, for developers it aims to be easy to extend and give a flexible system on which to rapidly develop added functionality, or prototype new protocols.

This branch provides **no configuration**, it requires manual configuration to make the app work as most would expect.
If you need to migrate from this branch, please check documentation of the `master` branch or get support in xmpp:yunohost-xmpp@muc.chapril.org?join .
