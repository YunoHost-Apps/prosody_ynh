Prosody is a modern XMPP communication server. It aims to be easy to set up and configure, and efficient with system resources. Additionally, for developers it aims to be easy to extend and give a flexible system on which to rapidly develop added functionality, or prototype new protocols.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  **Important note**

This app installs Prosody from Debian packages.
Basically, this means that you will not benefit from the latest versions of Prosody but benefit the stability and security of the Debian packaging.

üöÄ Target is to provide at least:
  * A/V calls (https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/1607) 
  * BOSH (https://forum.yunohost.org/t/unable-to-set-up-bosh-conf-nginx/12995)
  * invite links (if not covered by https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/1677)
  * File sharing for all usual filetypes (https://forum.yunohost.org/t/metronome-mime-types-for-metronome-again/20073)

...and ultimately an Advanced Server compliance level (https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0479.html).

‚úÖ What works:
  * install on YunoHost 12
  * LDAP auth
  * A/V calls
  * File upload
  * MUC
  * optional import of rosters, MUCs, bookmarks from Metronome (integrated service on Yunohost 11 or app on Yunohost 12) (pep is not supported, #12)
  * automatically install coturn if not yet present
  * XEP-0156, XEP-0163, XEP-0191, XEP-0215, XEP-0237, XEP-0280, XEP-0313, XEP-0363 (see 'xmpp_compliance' file), XEP-0421 TBC

üêû What does not work:
  * vjud (Users directory) (help welcomed!)

üôã TODO (help welcomed!):
  * usability by other apps:
    * [PeerTube](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/peertube_ynh): to be tested
    * [Movim](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/movim_ynh): app broken?
    * [Converse.js](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/converse_ynh): seems to work ü•≥
    * [Jitsi](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/jitsi_ynh): reported [to work](https://forum.yunohost.org/t/jitsi-install-fails-with-prosody-testing/35879) ü•≥ (you must install first the Prosody app, then the Jitsi app)
    * [Nextcloud](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/nextcloud_ynh): to be tested
    * [Libervia](https://salut-a-toi.org/): to be tested [non-working app](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/sat_ynh)
    * [biboumi](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/biboumi_ynh): currently [not working](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/biboumi_ynh/issues/29)
    * ...?
  * check initial configuration (DNS, ?) : information via PRE_INSTALL.md
  * update scripts/remove and others...
  * check/improve app score

# READ before install!
Ideally all the README :) but this in particular:
* You must ensure that your DNS configuration includes the subdomains `muc.`, `xmpp-upload.` and `pubsub.`
* You should **not** create Yunohost subdomains `muc.`, `xmpp-upload.` and `pubsub.`
* You have to deinstall Metronome app before to install this app (using the same ports).

# Additionnal infos
* Users connect on XMPP with their email address. Ensure in the Yunohost Users configuration panel they have an email address matching the domain on which you install Prosody. If not add an email alias.
