# Rationale for using Debian packages

Cons:

- for Yunohost users:
  - cannot benefit of all the latest features available upstream


Pros:

- for Yunohost users:
  - no compilation needed on server (thus able to install on old / low-performance devices)
  - stability and security of Debian packaging
- for the maintainers of the app in Yunohost:
  - automatically benefit from all the hard work already done by Debian maintainers
  - focus their energy on improving integration in Yunohost instead of fixing problems already fixed by Debian
