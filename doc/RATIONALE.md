# Rationale for using Debian packages

Cons:

- for yunohost users:
  - cannot benefit of all the latest features available upstream


Pros:

- for yunohost users:
  - no compilation needed on server
- for the maintainers of the app in yunohost:
  - automatically benefit from all the hard work already done by Debian maintainers
  - focus their energy on improving integration in yunohost instead of fixed problems already fixed by Debian
