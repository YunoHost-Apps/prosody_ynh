# Prosody for YunoHost

⚠️ This is a fork of the official Prosody app to install on Yunohost 12 and aiming at providing the best XMPP support possible!

This app is in Beta maturity (reported to work by several people, though few manual operations might be needed and some functionalities are still missing).

🚀 Target is to provide at least:
  * A/V calls (https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/1607) 
  * BOSH (https://forum.yunohost.org/t/unable-to-set-up-bosh-conf-nginx/12995)
  * invite links (if not covered by https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/1677)
  * File sharing for all usual filetypes (https://forum.yunohost.org/t/metronome-mime-types-for-metronome-again/20073)

...and ultimately an Advanced Server compliance level (https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0479.html).

✅ What works:
  * install on Yunohost 12
  * LDAP auth
  * A/V calls
  * File upload
  * MUC
  * optional import of rosters, MUCs, bookmarks from Metronome (integrated service on Yunohost 11 or app on Yunohost 12) (pep is not supported, #12)
  * automatically install coturn if not yet present (https://github.com/anubister/coturn_ynh/ , a fork compatible with Yunohost 12)
  * XEP-0163, XEP-0191, XEP-0215, XEP-0237, XEP-0280, XEP-0313, XEP-0363 (see 'xmpp_compliance' file), XEP-0421 TBC

🐞 What does not work:
  * vjud (Users directory) (help welcomed!)

🙋 TODO (help welcomed!):
  * if applicable manage migration from upstream version of coturn app
  * usability by other apps:
    * [PeerTube](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/peertube_ynh): to be tested
    * [Movim](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/movim_ynh): app broken?
    * [Converse.js](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/converse_ynh): seems to work
    * [Jitsi](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/jitsi_ynh): to be tested
    * [Nextcloud](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/nextcloud_ynh): to be tested
    * [Libervia](https://salut-a-toi.org/): to be tested [non-working app](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/sat_ynh)
    * ...?
  * check initial configuration (DNS, ?) : inform or block?
  * update scripts/remove and others...
  * check/improve app score

# READ before install!
Ideally all the README :) but this in particular:
* You must ensure that your DNS configuration includes the subdomains `muc.` and `xmpp-upload.`
* You should **not** create Yunohost subdomains `muc.` and `xmpp-upload.`
* (to be confirmed) You must apply the workaround for this bug : https://github.com/anubister/prosody_ynh/issues/4#issuecomment-2318658501
* You have to deinstall Metronome app before to install this app (using the same ports).

# Additionnal infos
* Users connect on XMPP with their email address. Ensure in the Yunohost Users configuration panel they have an email address matching the domain on which you install Prosody. If not add an email alias.
