⚠️ fork (work in progress) to install on Yunohost 12
and aiming at providing the best XMPP support possible!
Discussion on xmpp:yunohost-xmpp@muc.chapril.org?join ⚠️

Target is to provide at least:
  * A/V calls (https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/1607) 
  * BOSH (https://forum.yunohost.org/t/unable-to-set-up-bosh-conf-nginx/12995)
  * invite links (if not covered by https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/1677)
  * File sharing for all usual filetypes (https://forum.yunohost.org/t/metronome-mime-types-for-metronome-again/20073)

...and ultimately an Advanced Server compliance level (https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0479.html).
