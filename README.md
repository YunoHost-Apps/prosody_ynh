⚠️ fork (work in progress) to install on Yunohost 12
and aiming at providing the best XMPP support possible!
Discussion on xmpp:yunohost-xmpp@muc.chapril.org?join ⚠️

This app is in Beta maturity (reported to work by several people, though few manual operations are needed and some functionalities are still missing).

Target is to provide at least:
  * A/V calls (https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/1607) 
  * BOSH (https://forum.yunohost.org/t/unable-to-set-up-bosh-conf-nginx/12995)
  * invite links (if not covered by https://github.com/YunoHost/issues/issues/1677)
  * File sharing for all usual filetypes (https://forum.yunohost.org/t/metronome-mime-types-for-metronome-again/20073)

...and ultimately an Advanced Server compliance level (https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0479.html).

* What works:
  * install on brand new Yunohost 12
  * LDAP auth
  * A/V calls
  * File upload
  * MUC
  * automatically install coturn if not yet present (https://github.com/anubister/coturn_ynh/ , a fork compatible with Yunohost 12)
  * XEP-0163, XEP-0191, XEP-0215, XEP-0237, XEP-0280, XEP-0313, XEP-0363 (see 'xmpp_compliance' file)
* What does not work:
  * vjud (Users directory) (help welcomed!)
* TODO (help welcomed!):
  * do migration from Metronome datas on Yunohost 11 to Prosody
  * if applicable manage migration from upstream version of coturn app
  * usability by other apps (PeerTube, Movim, Converse.js, Jitsi, ... +?)
  * check initial configuration (DNS, ?) : inform or block?
  * update scripts/remove and others...
  * check app score

# READ before install!
Ideally all the README :) but this in particular:
* You must create in Yunohost the subdomains `muc.` and `xmpp-upload.`
* You must apply the workaround for this bug : https://github.com/anubister/prosody_ynh/issues/4#issuecomment-2318658501
